PRESENTATIONS

You should start with one of the templates in order to have the files auto start and to progress to the next slide automatically.

If you use the PowerPoint template, please save the file as .pps for the same reason 
- you can still save to the .pptx but when you are ready to upload it needs to be in the .pps format or you will only see the first slide.

If you want to convert an old PowerPoint presentation
- you will need to check Advance Slide After : X secs (found under the Transistions tab).
- you can either set each slide advancing (stay there while clicking on each slide) or wait until you are done with all slides
- if you choose to do them all the same select a time and choose Apply to All
- under the Slide Show tab, select Set Up Slide Show and then check the Loop continuously box
- check if you have animations by going under the Animation tab. Check each slide.
- if you have an animation, select each number (will only show up when the Animation tab is open) and delete it.
